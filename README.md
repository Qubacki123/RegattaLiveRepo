# RegattaLiveRepo
A repository for all of the files related to the Regatta Live Project.

Project is based on GNSS satellite navigation and it's purpose is to display current object (ultimately yacht) location on the map. Object's movement is presented by a moving marker with a trail behind. 

The work is based on many publicly licensed projects, libraries and repositories, such as

* Leaflet Realtime, https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet-realtime
* Waveshare SIM 7000E documentation, https://www.waveshare.com/sim7000e-nb-iot-hat.htm
* Socket Programming in Python (Guide) by Nathan Jennings, https://realpython.com/python-sockets/

Huge thanks to the above authors for their work and possibility to create more software based on their examples.

For anyone interested in my work I will gladly provide them with more detailed information and offer my cooperation.
